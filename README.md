## :thought_balloon: Introduction to CLI and CLI tools
- CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a way of interacting with a computer program or operating system using text commands typed into a terminal or command prompt. A CLI allows users to execute commands, navigate directories, and perform various tasks using keyboard input, instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) that relies on mouse clicks and icons.
- CLI tools are software programs that are designed to be used from the command line. They are usually lightweight and faster than their GUI counterparts, making them popular among developers and system administrators. CLI tools can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as text processing, file manipulation, system monitoring, network diagnostics, and more.
